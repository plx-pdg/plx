# Exos examples used for testing

These are exos in various languages to run tests suites on. We can make sure the checks results are coherent, that code can compile, that we can get output progressively, get the output even if a segfault happens, trim lines and various edge cases...

## Folders
1. `basics`: only code files in 3 languages, first simple and edge cases
1. `full` (TODO in another PR): a full course structure with several exos in multiple languages, including non trivial build situations
